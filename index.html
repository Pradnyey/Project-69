                    <p class="text-muted text-left">AIS has an excellent and well set-up library. It consists of a large hall filled with shelves, bookstands and furniture. The room is airy and spacious. More than fifty students can use it at the same time. 

There are books on every subject including history, geography, science, civics, English language and literature, computer, general knowledge, etc. There are also a good number of reference books.

There is the entire collection of Encyclopedia Britannica which is a real help for students. Each shelf contains a particular category of books. The stories’ section is the most sought after section of the library. Students can also borrow any book of the library with the permission of the librarian. The front section of the Library serves as Students Reading Room. It contains some newspapers and magazines. The teacher’s Reference section serves both as reading room as well as a room for reading up resource books.

They instill in the young minds, the habit of reading, which will stand them in good stead in the future. The reference section helps them to clear their doubts while the reading room makes them conversant with the current affairs and day-to-day events of their country as well as of the whole world.

Thus, a good library is an asset. It widens student’s mind, improves their knowledge, clears their doubts and instills in them the habit of reading. Libraries help to make learning a self-discovery and a personal venture.</p>
